# SmartDustbin_with_IoT
Smart Dustbin is just a normal bin where everyone can dispose waste but integration of some hardware components is done for more efficient use of it. Smart Dustbin is integrated with some hardware components such as Arduino, Servo Motor, Ultrasonic sensors.

Componenets Required: 1.Arduino UNO 2.Ultrasonic Sensor(HC-SR04) 3.ServoMotor 4.Breadboard 5.Jumper

A simple but useful project called Smart Dustbin using Arduino is designed and developed here. Using this project, the lid of the dustbin stays closed, so that waste is not exposed (to avoid flies and mosquitos) and when you want dispose any waste, it will automatically open the lid.
